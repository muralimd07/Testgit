## Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)

1. This algorithm schedules those processes first which have the longest processing time remaining for completion. 
2. This algorithm can also be called the preemptive version of the  Longest Job First  Scheduling algorithm. 


| Process Id | 	Arrival Time|	 Burst Time |
| :---  |    :----:|   ----:|
| P1 |	 0 |	 2 |
| P2 |	 1 |	 5 |
| P3 |	 4 |	 3 |
| P4 |	 5 |	 2 |
